# Target
## Track Description
Microblogging sites like Twitter are increasingly being used for aiding relief operations during disaster events. In such situations, identifying actionable information like needs and availabilities of various types of resources is critical for effective coordination of post disaster relief operations. However, such critical information is usually submerged within a lot of conversational content, such as sympathy for the victims of the disaster. Hence, automated IR techniques are needed to find and process such information.In this track, we focus on two types of tweets:

1. Need-tweets: Tweets which inform about the need or requirement of some specific resource such as food, water, medical aid, shelter, mobile or Internet connectivity, etc. Note that tweets which do not directly specify the need, but point to scarcity or non-availability of some resources (i.e., a covert expression of the need) are also included in this category. For instance, the tweet “Mobile phones not working” is considered as a need-tweet, since it informs about the need for mobile connectivity.

2. Availability-tweets: Tweets which inform about the availability of some specific resources. This class includes both tweets which inform about potential availability, such as resources being transported or dispatched to the disaster-struck area, as well as tweets informing about the actual availability in the disaster-struck area, such as food being distributed, etc.

Note that a particular tweet may be both a need-tweet and an availability-tweet  if it informs about the need of some specific resource, as well as the availability of some other resource.
